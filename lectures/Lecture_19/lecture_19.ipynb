That is, a small KL-divergence doesn't capture our intuition about what it means for two distributions to be similar.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. The Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling Diagnostic**: If the variational approximation $q$ is very different than $p$, then the importance sampling MC estimate of $\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\text{Data})}\\left[ f(\\theta) \\right]$,\n",

    "\\mathbb{E}_{p(\\theta|\\text{Data})}\\left[ f(\\theta) \\right] \\approx \\frac{1}{S}\\sum_{s=1}^S \\frac{p(\\theta|\\text{Data})}{q(\\theta)} f(\\theta_s),\\; \\theta_s \\sim q(\\theta)\n",

Thus, methods of smoothing the weights, like ***Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling (PSIS)*** will have poor performance. The efficacy of PSIS can be used as a diagnostic tool for testing if $q$ is similar to $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The Variational Simulation-Based Calibration (VSBC) Diagnostic**: Given a Bayesian model $p(y, \\theta) = p(y|\\theta) p(\\theta)$, if your variational inference proceedure is good at approximating the posterior $p(\\theta|y)$ then it should do well for most sets of data that is generated from the model $p(y, \\theta)$.\n",

We then perform a calibration test on each variational approximation. This will reveal if your variational inference procedure is biased - produces approximation that are consistently flawed in some specific way."
